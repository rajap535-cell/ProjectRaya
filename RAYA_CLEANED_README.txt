Raya cleaned project (assistant-created)
- Replaced raya_core/qa_engine.py with a robust cache->wiki->online engine.
- Replaced engine.py with a simple, consistent local-knowledge + wikipedia + duckduckgo fallback.
- Did NOT modify CLI (RAYA.py) beyond file placements. Please run from your project root.
Debugging: set environment variable RAYA_DEBUG=1 to see source tags.
