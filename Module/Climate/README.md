# 🌍 Raya Climate Module — Phase 6  
### Predict & Control Weather Impacts

The *Climate Module* is part of Raya’s mission toward a *Type 1 Civilization* — developing intelligent systems that can monitor, predict, and control natural processes like weather and climate for planetary-scale sustainability.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. *Predict & Control Weather Impacts*  
   Build ML-based climate forecasting systems using sensor and satellite data.

2. *Cyclone, Flood, and Drought Prevention Models*  
   Develop simulation tools and early warning models for disaster mitigation.

## 🧩 Problem Statements

| Task | Description | Example Approach |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| Weather prediction | Predict rainfall, humidity, or temperature anomalies | Time-series forecasting using LSTM, Prophet, or ARIMA |
| Flood detection | Identify flood-prone areas based on data | CNN/ML classification using topographical maps & satellite images |
| Drought prediction | Predict drought risk based on long-term rainfall & soil data | Regression or anomaly detection models |
| Cyclone tracking | Estimate cyclone intensity or path | ML models trained on satellite trajectory datasets |

## 🔄 Basic ML Pipeline

1. *Data Collection* — Download weather data (CSV/JSON/API).
2. *Preprocessing* — Handle missing values, normalize, create time-series windows.
3. *Feature Engineering* — Extract meaningful features (temperature trend, humidity difference, etc.).
4. *Model Training* — Build baseline models (Linear Regression, LSTM, XGBoost).
5. *Evaluation* — Measure with RMSE/MAE/Accuracy.
6. *Visualization* — Plot predictions vs actual trends.
7. *Deployment (optional)* — Serve via Flask API or stream data into a dashboard.

## 🧠 Expected Deliverables

- *Phase 1 (Prototype):* Small ML model predicting one climate metric (e.g., rainfall).  
- *Phase 2 (Expansion):* Add IoT/sensor integration for real-time updates.  
- *Phase 3 (Visualization):* Dashboard or API output for insights.
